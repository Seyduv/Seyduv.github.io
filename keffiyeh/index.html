                The Names of the Keffiyeh
            </h3>
            <p class="section-par">
                The Keffiyeh has many names, with these names differentiating the variants a lot of the time. Here they are explained:
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Keffiyeh"(<span class="arabic">الكوفية</span> in Arabic), mostly used in Palestine, Iraq and Israel. It litterally translates to "From Kufa",A city in southern Iraq. This name is newer, Kufa didnt exist until after the decline of Sumer
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Shemagh"(<span class="arabic">شماغ</span> in Arabic), used in Jordan, Syria and Saudi Arabia, The Shemagh is somewhat different from the Keffiyeh, it is basically the same scarf tho.
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Hatta"(<span class="arabic">حطة</span> in Arabic), used in Jordan, Iraq, and Palestine. It is the original name of the scarf, originating in Sumer.
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Yashmagh"(<span class="arabic">يشماغ</span> in Arabic), used in Saudi Arabia, this name is a variant of the name "Shemagh".
                <br>According to it's color, the Keffiyeh can be named differently, like this:
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red: Shemagh, this is likely due to the fact the Jordanian Shemagh is Red
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black: Keffiyeh, this is likely due to the fact the Palestinian Shemagh is Black
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plain white: Ghutra, this one is used in the Peninsula
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plain green: Khderia

                    This variant originated among the Syrians, and is predominantly black and white. In Syria however a large ammount of people wear the Jordanian Shemagh, likely due to shared Levantine history with Jordan, however some Syrians also wear the Sinayan Shemagh, which likely got there in the times of the United Arab Republic. This Shemagh became widely used among the western militaries, and militias.

                The events of September 11th 2001 changed many people's view on the Keffiyeh, as extremist groups tended to use it to hide their identities. Alltho this has been happening for decades and the keffiyeh was already associated with militant groups, like the PLO, and PFLP, videos of this didnt go viral until 2001. Among militant groups utalizing it are:
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/alqaeda" class="not-working">Al Qaeda</a> (which uses the Sinaian, and sometimes Palestinian or Jordanian keffiyehs)
